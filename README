Working on learning more JavaScript, mostly from JavaScript: The Good Parts.

The Crockford modified some of the core objects of JavaScript with extensions that he found useful.  These extensions may not be in the main language, and they seem like they would be useful.  So, time to type them in somewhere so that I can include them when needed in code work.
