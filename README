I am working on learning more JavaScript, mostly from JavaScript: The Good Parts and the Crockford videos in the YUI Theater collection.

In his book JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford modified some of the core objects of JavaScript with extensions that he found useful.  These extensions aren't in the main language, and they seem useful.  I want them available to play with while I work on picking up more of the language.
